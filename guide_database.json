MD5, SHA256, etc.) to turn data into a unique, shorter fixed-length string\nof random numbers & letters known as a hash value or, hash.\n\u2022 It is possible for 2 data to have the same hash.\n  This is known as a hash collision, although such occurrence is rare\n\u2022 A 1-way hashing algorithm means that you can't reverse the hash to get back\n  the original data\n  \u2022 This is different from encryption, which is 2-way (reversible)", "1.1 Will the hash be different or the same?": "Changing data's content \u2192 Hash will be different\nChanging data's metadata (E.g. file name) \u2192 Hash will be the same\nDuplicating a file \u2192 Both files' hashes will be the same\nCreate a new file that has the same content as another file \u2192 Both file's hashes\nwill be the same\nCreate a new file with the same content as another file but of a\ndifferent file type \u2192 Both file's hashes will be different", "1.2 What's the purpose of hashing?": "Hashing is used to:\n\u2022 Safely store sensitive data (E.g.

The message to be hashed is padded such that its length is congruent to\n   448 modulo 512 (i.e. The message is extended so that it's just 64 bits away\n   from being a multiple of 512 bits long)\n   \u2022 Padding is performed even if the message length is already congruent\n     to 448 modulo 512\n   \u2022 How the padding is done: 1 '1' bit is appended to the message,\n     followed by '0' bits so that the length in bits of the padded message\n     becomes congruent to 448 modulo 512\n2. A 64-bit representation of the original bit length of the message is appended\n   to the result of step 1. If the original bit length is greater than 2^64,\n   only the low-order 64 bits of the original bit length are used\n   (These bits are appended as 2 32-bit words & appended low-order word first).\n   At this point, the resulting message (after padding with bits & the original bit\n   length) has a length that's an exact multiple of 512 bits. Equivalently, this\n   message has a length that's an exact multiple of 16 (32-bit) words\n3. A 4 word buffer (A, B, C, D), each a 32-bit register, is used to compute the\n   message digest. A, B, C & D are initialized to the following values in\n   hexadecimal (low-order bytes first):\n   +------------------+\n   |word A|01|23|45|67|\n   +------------------+\n   |word B|89|AB|CD|EF|\n   +------------------+\n   |word C|FE|DC|BA|98|\n   +------------------+\n   |word D|76|54|32|10|\n   +------------------+\n4. 4 auxiliary functions are defined, each taking the input as 3 32-bit words\n   & producing 1 32-bit word as the output:\n   +------------------------------+\n   |F(X,Y,Z) = XY or not(X)Z      |\n   +------------------------------+\n   |G(X,Y,Z) = XZ or Y not(Z)     |\n   +------------------------------+\n   |H(X,Y,Z) = X xor Y xor Z      |\n   +------------------------------+\n   |I(X,Y,Z) = Y xor (X or not(Z))|\n   +------------------------------+", "2.2 Pros and Cons of MD5": "Pros:\n\u2022 Low computational requirements\n\u2022 Easier to compare & store\n\u2022 Very easy to generate a message digest of the original message\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Hash collision is very common\n  \u2022 Thus prone to collision attacks (E.g.
